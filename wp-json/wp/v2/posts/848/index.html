It contains Tags and Attributes that are used to design the web pages. Also, we can link multiple pages using Hyperlinks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The basic structure of an HTML page is laid out as :-<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/HTML-Basic-Format.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-853\" width=\"593\" height=\"412\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-large-font-size\"><strong>CSS<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/CSS3_logo_and_wordmark.svg.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-854\" width=\"216\" height=\"304\"\/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><strong>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)<\/strong>is used to apply styles to web pages. Cascading Style Sheets are fondly referred to as CSS. It is used to make web pages presentable. The reason for using this is to simplify the process of making web pages presentable. It allows you to apply styles on web pages. More importantly, it enables you to do this independently of the HTML that makes up each web page.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Styling is an essential property for any website. It increases the standards and overall look of the website that makes it easier for the user to interact with it. A website can be made without CSS, as styling is MUST since no user would want to interact with a dull and shabby website.

Unfortunately, in some scenarios, the functionality that programming languages by themselves provide is not enough.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let\u2019s imagine that you want to build a house and have every kind of tool in your possession. Hammers of every imaginable size and shape, shovels, chainsaws, electric drills, concrete mixers, and so on. The problem is, to build a door, you\u2019ll have to go to the forest, find a suitable tree, cut it into parts, match them together, paint, attach handles and hinges. Crafting a window will take much more time and effort. Plus, no one knows what glass is made of.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The more optimal approach implies the use of pre-build components you can combine following specific rules and using the tools you have. You can use bricks to build the walls and shingles to cover the roof. Doors, windows, and pipes can be combined to ensure that the house of your dreams looks and functions the way you want. However, one must not forget to test everything to make sure that the chimney does not fall off every time you try to open a window.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As you may have guessed, in this analogy, ready-to-use blocks represent frameworks. Developers use programming languages (hammers, shovels, etc.) to build frameworks (doors and windows) to be used by other developers in their applications.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\"><strong>CSS framework&#8217;s<\/strong> <\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Bootstrap<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/2918581.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-859\" width=\"199\" height=\"199\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Bootstrap is a free and open-source tool collection for creating responsive websites and web applications.

It is maintained by Facebook.React uses a declarative paradigm that makes it easier to reason about your application and aims to be both efficient and flexible. It designs simple views for each state in your application, and React will efficiently update and render just the right component when your data changes. The declarative view makes your code more predictable and easier to debug.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Angular Js<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/AngularJS-Shield.svg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-865\" width=\"219\" height=\"232\"\/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">AngularJS is&nbsp;<strong>a Javascript open-source front-end framework that is mainly used to develop single-page web applications(SPAs)<\/strong>.
