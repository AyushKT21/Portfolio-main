<p class="has-large-font-size"><strong>HTML</strong></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img decoding="async" src="/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/HTML5_logo_and_wordmark.svg.png" alt="" class="wp-image-850" width="320" height="320"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><strong>HTML</strong>&nbsp;stands for<strong>&nbsp;HyperText Markup Language</strong>. It is used to design web pages using the&nbsp;<strong>markup language</strong>. HTML is the combination of&nbsp;<strong>Hypertext</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>Markup language</strong>. Hypertext defines the link between the web pages and markup language defines the text document within the tag that define the structure of web pages.</figcaption></figure>



<p>HTML is used to create the structure of web pages that are displayed on the World Wide Web (www). It contains Tags and Attributes that are used to design the web pages. Also, we can link multiple pages using Hyperlinks.</p>



<p>The basic structure of an HTML page is laid out as :-</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/HTML-Basic-Format.png" alt="" class="wp-image-853" width="593" height="412"/></figure>



<p class="has-large-font-size"><strong>CSS</strong></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/CSS3_logo_and_wordmark.svg.png" alt="" class="wp-image-854" width="216" height="304"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><strong>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)</strong>is used to apply styles to web pages. Cascading Style Sheets are fondly referred to as CSS. It is used to make web pages presentable. The reason for using this is to simplify the process of making web pages presentable. It allows you to apply styles on web pages. More importantly, it enables you to do this independently of the HTML that makes up each web page.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Styling is an essential property for any website. It increases the standards and overall look of the website that makes it easier for the user to interact with it. A website can be made without CSS, as styling is MUST since no user would want to interact with a dull and shabby website. So for knowing Web Development, learning CSS is mandatory.</p>



<p>Basic format for CSS can be seen as:-</p>

<p class="has-large-font-size"><strong>JAVASCRIPT</strong></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/javascript_logo-1.png" alt="" class="wp-image-857" width="267" height="267"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><strong>JavaScript (JS)</strong>&nbsp;is the world’s most popular lightweight, interpreted compiled programming language.

<p class="has-large-font-size"><strong>FRAMEWORK&#8217;s</strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">For creating a well enough website you will need some frameworks of these languages as well :</p>



<p>Before looking forward for frameworks a basic question arrives in student&#8217;s mind is that why do we use framework?</p>



<p>As you can see, modern programming languages provide enough flexibility to build any kind of applications. Unfortunately, in some scenarios, the functionality that programming languages by themselves provide is not enough.</p>



<p>Let’s imagine that you want to build a house and have every kind of tool in your possession. Hammers of every imaginable size and shape, shovels, chainsaws, electric drills, concrete mixers, and so on. The problem is, to build a door, you’ll have to go to the forest, find a suitable tree, cut it into parts, match them together, paint, attach handles and hinges. Crafting a window will take much more time and effort. Plus, no one knows what glass is made of.</p>



<p>The more optimal approach implies the use of pre-build components you can combine following specific rules and using the tools you have. You can use bricks to build the walls and shingles to cover the roof. Doors, windows, and pipes can be combined to ensure that the house of your dreams looks and functions the way you want. However, one must not forget to test everything to make sure that the chimney does not fall off every time you try to open a window.</p>



<p>As you may have guessed, in this analogy, ready-to-use blocks represent frameworks. Developers use programming languages (hammers, shovels, etc.) to build frameworks (doors and windows) to be used by other developers in their applications.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>CSS framework&#8217;s</strong> </p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Bootstrap</strong></li>
</ul>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/2918581.png" alt="" class="wp-image-859" width="199" height="199"/></figure>



<p>Bootstrap is a free and open-source tool collection for creating responsive websites and web applications. It is the most popular HTML, CSS, and JavaScript framework for developing responsive, mobile-first websites. Nowadays, the websites are perfect for all the browsers (IE, Firefox, and Chrome) and for all sizes of screens (Desktop, Tablets, Phablets, and Phones).All thanks to Bootstrap developers – Mark Otto and Jacob Thornton of Twitter, though it was later declared to be an open-source project.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Tailwind</strong></li>
</ul>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/download.png" alt="" class="wp-image-860" width="203" height="124"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Tailwind CSS is basically a Utility first CSS framework for building rapid custom UI. It is a highly customizable, low-level CSS framework that gives you all of the building blocks that you need. Also, it is a cool way to write inline styling and achieve an awesome interface without writing a single line of your own CSS. <br>There are many CSS frameworks but people always choose the fast and easy framework to learn and use in the project. Tailwind has come with inbuilt a lot of features and styles for users to choose from and is also used to reduce the tendency of writing CSS code and create a beautiful custom UI. It will help you to overcome complicated task.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure>



<ul>
<li><strong>Foundation</strong></li>
</ul>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/foundation-logo-AA9B725281-seeklogo.com_.png" alt="" class="wp-image-861" width="154" height="229"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">A Foundation is an open-source and responsive front-end framework created by ZURB in September 2011 that makes it simple to create stunning responsive websites, apps, and emails that operate on any device. Many companies, like Facebook, eBay, Mozilla, Adobe, and even Disney, use it. The framework is based on bootstrap, which is similar to SaaS. It’s more complex, versatile, and configurable.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Similarly, there are many more frameworks of CSS like skeleton, animate, semantic, tacit, bulma, etc&#8230;</p>



<p><strong>JAVASCRIPT Framework&#8217;s</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><strong>React.Js</strong></li>
</ul>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/1460px-React_logo.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-864" width="177" height="162"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It’s ‘V’ in MVC. ReactJS is an open-source, component-based front-end library responsible only for the view layer of the application. It is maintained by Facebook.React uses a declarative paradigm that makes it easier to reason about your application and aims to be both efficient and flexible. It designs simple views for each state in your application, and React will efficiently update and render just the right component when your data changes. The declarative view makes your code more predictable and easier to debug.</figcaption></figure>



<ul>
<li><strong>Angular Js</strong></li>
</ul>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/AngularJS-Shield.svg" alt="" class="wp-image-865" width="219" height="232"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">AngularJS is&nbsp;<strong>a Javascript open-source front-end framework that is mainly used to develop single-page web applications(SPAs)</strong>. It is a continuously growing and expanding framework which provides better ways for developing web applications. It changes the static HTML to dynamic HTML.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Why we use Angular?</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Easy to work with:</strong>&nbsp;All you need to know to work with AngularJs is basics of HTML,CSS and Javascript,not necessary to be an expert in these technologies.</li>



<li><strong>Time-saving:</strong>&nbsp;AngularJs allows us to work with components and hence we can use them again which saves time and unnecessary code.</li>



<li><strong>Ready to use template:</strong>&nbsp;AngularJs is mainly plain HTML, and it mainly makes use of the plain HTML template and passes it to the DOM and then the AngularJS compiler. It traverses the templates and then they are ready to use.</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li><strong>Next.Js</strong></li>
</ul>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/download-1.png" alt="" class="wp-image-866" width="296" height="59"/></figure>



<p><strong>Next.js</strong>&nbsp;is a react based framework. It has powers to Develop beautiful Web application for different platform like Windows, Linux and mac. If you have little experience in react and looking forward to know more about react ecosystem then you should have knowledge about Next.js framework. Let’s have a brief introduction about Next.js.</p>



<p>Next.js is based on react, webpack and babel. It is an awesome tool for creating web application and famous for server-side rendering. Next.js is build by&nbsp;Zeit. Developers with knowledge of HTML, CSS, Java Script and React can easily learn and switch to next.js.</p>



<p><strong>Main Features:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Hot Code Reloading:</strong>&nbsp;It automatically reloads the application when changes in the code get saved.</li>



<li><strong>Automatic Code Splitting:</strong>&nbsp;By this feature, every import in the code get bundled and served with each page. It means that unnecessary code never get loaded on the page.</li>



<li><strong>Ecosystem Compatibility:</strong>&nbsp;Compatible with JavaScript, Node and react.</li>



<li><strong>Server Rendering:</strong>&nbsp;Easily render react component on server before sending HTML to client.</li>



<li><strong>Styled-JSX:</strong> Styled-JSX allows you to write CSS directly inside JavaScript code.</li>
</ul>

					<description><![CDATA[Database Management Systems (DBMS) are software systems used to store, retrieve, and run queries on data. A DBMS serves as an interface between an end-user and a database, allowing users to create, read, update, and delete data in the database.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[

<h2><strong>DEFINE DBMS :&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<h4><strong>Data base is a collection of related data in a systematic manner. It is a system of storing and taking care of data , data can be easily accessed managed and updated. Data base can have multiple tables.Database is controlled through a software called DBMS.</strong></h4>



<h3><strong>SO what is DBMS?</strong></h3>



<h4><strong>-DBMS is a computer software application.</strong></h4>



<p><strong>-DBMS interact with user , other application and Database itself to retire and analysis the data.accept request for data from an application and instructs OS and provide specific data.-DBMS allows users&nbsp; to create their own data.</strong></p>



<p><strong>example -Oracle , Microsoft , SQL ,&nbsp; MySQL ,&nbsp; DB2 , ORION , IMS&nbsp; , Foxpro , MongoDB</strong>.</p>



<h1>TYPES OF DATABASES</h1>



<p>There are various types of databases used for storing different varieties of data:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://static.javatpoint.com/dbms/images/types-of-databases.png" alt="Types of Databases"/></figure>



<h2>1) CENTRALIZED DATABASE</h2>



<p>It is the type of database that stores data at a centralized database system. It comforts the users to access the stored data from different locations through several applications. These applications contain the authentication process to let users access data securely. An example of a Centralized database can be Central Library that carries a central database of each library in a college/university.</p>



<h3>Advantages of Centralized Database</h3>



<ul><li>It has decreased the risk of data management, i.e., manipulation of data will not affect the core data.</li><li>Data consistency is maintained as it manages data in a central repository.</li><li>It provides better data quality, which enables organizations to establish data standards.</li><li>It is less costly because fewer vendors are required to handle the data sets.</li></ul>



<h3>Disadvantages of Centralized Database</h3>



<ul><li>The size of the centralized database is large, which increases the response time for fetching the data.</li><li>It is not easy to update such an extensive database system.</li><li>If any server failure occurs, entire data will be lost, which could be a huge loss.</li></ul>



<h2>2) DISTRIBUTED DATABASE</h2>



<p>Unlike a centralized database system, in distributed systems, data is distributed among different database systems of an organization. These database systems are connected via communication links. Such links help the end-users to access the data easily.&nbsp;<strong>Examples</strong>&nbsp;of the Distributed database are Apache Cassandra, HBase, Ignite, etc.</p>



<p>We can further divide a distributed database system into:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://static.javatpoint.com/dbms/images/types-of-databases2.png" alt="Types of Databases"/></figure>



<ul><li><strong>Homogeneous DDB:</strong>&nbsp;Those database systems which execute on the same operating system and use the same application process and carry the same hardware devices.</li><li><strong>Heterogeneous DDB:</strong>&nbsp;Those database systems which execute on different operating systems under different application procedures, and carries different hardware devices.</li></ul>



<h3>Advantages of Distributed Database</h3>



<ul><li>Modular development is possible in a distributed database, i.e., the system can be expanded by including new computers and connecting them to the distributed system.</li><li>One server failure will not affect the entire data set.</li></ul>



<h2>3) RELATIONAL DATABASE</h2>



<p>This database is based on the relational data model, which stores data in the form of rows(tuple) and columns(attributes), and together forms a table(relation). A relational database uses SQL for storing, manipulating, as well as maintaining the data. E.F. Codd invented the database in 1970. Each table in the database carries a key that makes the data unique from others.&nbsp;<strong>Examples</strong>&nbsp;of Relational databases are MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle, etc.</p>



<h3>Properties of Relational Database</h3>



<p>There are following four commonly known properties of a relational model known as ACID properties, where:</p>



<p><strong>A means Atomicity:</strong>&nbsp;This ensures the data operation will complete either with success or with failure. It follows the ‘all or nothing’ strategy. For example, a transaction will either be committed or will abort.</p>



<p><strong>C means Consistency:</strong>&nbsp;If we perform any operation over the data, its value before and after the operation should be preserved. For example, the account balance before and after the transaction should be correct, i.e., it should remain conserved.</p>



<p><strong>I means Isolation:</strong>&nbsp;There can be concurrent users for accessing data at the same time from the database. Thus, isolation between the data should remain isolated. For example, when multiple transactions occur at the same time, one transaction effects should not be visible to the other transactions in the database.</p>



<p><strong>D means Durability:</strong>&nbsp;It ensures that once it completes the operation and commits the data, data changes should remain permanent.</p>



<h2>4) NOSQL DATABASE</h2>



<p>Non-SQL/Not Only SQL is a type of database that is used for storing a wide range of data sets. It is not a relational database as it stores data not only in tabular form but in several different ways. It came into existence when the demand for building modern applications increased. Thus, NoSQL presented a wide variety of database technologies in response to the demands. We can further divide a NoSQL database into the following four types:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://static.javatpoint.com/dbms/images/types-of-databases3.png" alt="Types of Databases"/></figure>



<ol><li><strong>Key-value storage:</strong>&nbsp;It is the simplest type of database storage where it stores every single item as a key (or attribute name) holding its value, together.</li><li><strong>Document-oriented Database:</strong>&nbsp;A type of database used to store data as JSON-like document. It helps developers in storing data by using the same document-model format as used in the application code.</li><li><strong>Graph Databases:</strong>&nbsp;It is used for storing vast amounts of data in a graph-like structure. Most commonly, social networking websites use the graph database.</li><li><strong>Wide-column stores:</strong>&nbsp;It is similar to the data represented in relational databases. Here, data is stored in large columns together, instead of storing in rows.</li></ol>



<h3>Advantages of NoSQL Database</h3>



<ul><li>It enables good productivity in the application development as it is not required to store data in a structured format.</li><li>It is a better option for managing and handling large data sets.</li><li>It provides high scalability.</li><li>Users can quickly access data from the database through key-value.</li></ul>



<h2>5) CLOUD DATABASE</h2>



<p>A type of database where data is stored in a virtual environment and executes over the cloud computing platform. It provides users with various cloud computing services (SaaS, PaaS, IaaS, etc.) for accessing the database. There are numerous cloud platforms, but the best options are:</p>



<ul><li>Amazon Web Services(AWS)</li><li>Microsoft Azure</li><li>Kamatera</li><li>PhonixNAP</li><li>ScienceSoft</li><li>Google Cloud SQL, etc.</li></ul>



<h2>6) OBJECT-ORIENTED DATABASES</h2>



<p>The type of database that uses the object-based data model approach for storing data in the database system. The data is represented and stored as objects which are similar to the objects used in the object-oriented programming language.</p>



<h2>7) HIERARCHICAL DATABASES</h2>



<p>It is the type of database that stores data in the form of parent-children relationship nodes. Here, it organizes data in a tree-like structure.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://static.javatpoint.com/dbms/images/types-of-databases4.png" alt="Types of Databases"/></figure>



<p>Data get stored in the form of records that are connected via links. Each child record in the tree will contain only one parent. On the other hand, each parent record can have multiple child records.</p>



<h2>8) NETWORK DATABASES</h2>



<p>It is the database that typically follows the network data model. Here, the representation of data is in the form of nodes connected via links between them. Unlike the hierarchical database, it allows each record to have multiple children and parent nodes to form a generalized graph structure.</p>



<h2>9) PERSONAL DATABASE</h2>



<p>Collecting and storing data on the user’s system defines a Personal Database. This database is basically designed for a single user.</p>



<h3>Advantage of Personal Database</h3>



<ul><li>It is simple and easy to handle.</li><li>It occupies less storage space as it is small in size.</li></ul>



<h2>10) OPERATIONAL DATABASE</h2>



<p>The type of database which creates and updates the database in real-time. It is basically designed for executing and handling the daily data operations in several businesses. For example, An organization uses operational databases for managing per day transactions.</p>



<h2><strong>APPLICATIONS OF DBMS</strong></h2>



<p><strong><u>1. Banking ( All transactions) :&nbsp;</u></strong>We make thousands of transactions through banks daily and we can do this without going to the bank. So how banking has become so easy that by sitting at home we can send or get money through banks. That is all possible just because of DBMS that manages all the bank transactions.<br><br><strong><u>2. Airlines ( Reservation schedule )&nbsp;</u>:&nbsp;</strong>Airlines use databases for&nbsp;<strong>storing passenger information when tickets are booked and when passengers check-in at the airport</strong>.<br><br><strong><u>4. manufacturing (production , inventory , order )</u>&nbsp;:&nbsp;</strong>Manufacturing companies make products and sell them on the daily basis. To keep records of all the details about the products like quantity, bills, purchase, supply chain management, DBMS is used.<br><br><strong><u>4. Human resources ( employee recard&nbsp; ,&nbsp; salaries )&nbsp;</u>:&nbsp;</strong>Big firms have many workers working under them. The human resource management department keeps records of each employee’s salary, tax, and work through DBMS.<br><br><strong><u>5. Tele communication ( record of calls , monthly bills )</u>&nbsp;:&nbsp;</strong>Any telecommunication company cannot even think about its business without DBMS. DBMS is a must for these companies to store the call details and monthly post-paid bills<br><br><strong><u>6. Universities ( grades , registration ) :</u>&nbsp;</strong>Examinations are done online today and universities and colleges maintain all these records through DBMS. Student’s registrations details, results, courses, and grades all the information are stored in the database.</p>



<h2><strong>ADVANTAGES OF DBMS&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p><strong>1. Data independence&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p><strong>2. Efficient data access&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p><strong>3. Data integrity and&nbsp; security&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p><strong>4. Data administration&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p><strong>5. Reduce application development</strong></p>



<p><strong>6. Concurrent access and crash recovery</strong></p>

<h2><strong>What is C++?</strong></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Screenshot-56.png" alt="" class="wp-image-48" width="321" height="344"/></figure>



<p>C++ is a cross-platform language that can be used to create high-performance applications.</p>



<p>C++ was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup, as an extension to the C language.</p>



<p>C++ gives programmers a high level of control over system resources and memory.</p>



<p>The language was updated 4 major times in 2011, 2014, 2017, and 2020 to C++11, C++14, C++17, C++20.</p>

<h2><strong>Why Use C++</strong></h2>



<ul><li>C++ is one of the world&#8217;s most popular programming languages.</li><li>C++ can be found in today&#8217;s operating systems, Graphical User Interfaces, and embedded systems.</li><li>C++ is an object-oriented programming language which gives a clear structure to programs and allows code to be reused, lowering development costs.</li><li>C++ is portable and can be used to develop applications that can be adapted to multiple platforms.</li><li>C++ is fun and easy to learn!</li><li>As C++ is close to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.w3schools.com/cs/index.php">C#</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.w3schools.com/java/default.asp">Java</a>, it makes it easy for programmers to switch to C++ or vice versa.</li></ul>
