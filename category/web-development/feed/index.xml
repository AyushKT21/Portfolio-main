<p class="has-large-font-size"><strong>HTML</strong></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img decoding="async" src="/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/HTML5_logo_and_wordmark.svg.png" alt="" class="wp-image-850" width="320" height="320"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><strong>HTML</strong>&nbsp;stands for<strong>&nbsp;HyperText Markup Language</strong>. It is used to design web pages using the&nbsp;<strong>markup language</strong>. HTML is the combination of&nbsp;<strong>Hypertext</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>Markup language</strong>. Hypertext defines the link between the web pages and markup language defines the text document within the tag that define the structure of web pages.</figcaption></figure>



<p>HTML is used to create the structure of web pages that are displayed on the World Wide Web (www). It contains Tags and Attributes that are used to design the web pages. Also, we can link multiple pages using Hyperlinks.</p>



<p>The basic structure of an HTML page is laid out as :-</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/HTML-Basic-Format.png" alt="" class="wp-image-853" width="593" height="412"/></figure>



<p class="has-large-font-size"><strong>CSS</strong></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/CSS3_logo_and_wordmark.svg.png" alt="" class="wp-image-854" width="216" height="304"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><strong>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)</strong>is used to apply styles to web pages. Cascading Style Sheets are fondly referred to as CSS. It is used to make web pages presentable. The reason for using this is to simplify the process of making web pages presentable. It allows you to apply styles on web pages. More importantly, it enables you to do this independently of the HTML that makes up each web page.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Styling is an essential property for any website. It increases the standards and overall look of the website that makes it easier for the user to interact with it. A website can be made without CSS, as styling is MUST since no user would want to interact with a dull and shabby website. So for knowing Web Development, learning CSS is mandatory.</p>



<p>Basic format for CSS can be seen as:-</p>

<p class="has-large-font-size"><strong>JAVASCRIPT</strong></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/javascript_logo-1.png" alt="" class="wp-image-857" width="267" height="267"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><strong>JavaScript (JS)</strong>&nbsp;is the world’s most popular lightweight, interpreted compiled programming language. It is also known as a scripting language for web pages. It can be used for&nbsp;<strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/server-side-client-side-programming/" target="_blank">Client-side</a></strong>&nbsp;as well as&nbsp;<strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/server-side-client-side-programming/" target="_blank">Server-side</a></strong>&nbsp;developments.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Syntax:</strong>&nbsp;It is the basic syntax to write code.         </p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong>&nbsp;A basic example to embed JS code in an HTML file is :-</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table class="has-ast-global-color-2-color has-text-color"><tbody><tr><td><code>&lt;!DOCTYPEhtml&gt;</code><br><code>&lt;htmllang="en"&gt;</code><br><code>&lt;head&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</code><br><code>&lt;title&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</code><br><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Basic Example to Describe JavaScript&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</code><br><code>&nbsp;&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;</code><br><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;!-- JavaScript code can be embedded inside&nbsp;&nbsp;</code><br><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;head section or body section --&gt;&nbsp;</code><br><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;script&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</code><br><code>&nbsp;console.log("Welcome to CodingSansaar");&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</code><br><code>&nbsp;&lt;/script&gt;</code><br><code>&lt;/body&gt;</code><br><code>&lt;/html&gt;</code></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p class="has-large-font-size"><strong>FRAMEWORK&#8217;s</strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">For creating a well enough website you will need some frameworks of these languages as well :</p>



<p>Before looking forward for frameworks a basic question arrives in student&#8217;s mind is that why do we use framework?</p>



<p>As you can see, modern programming languages provide enough flexibility to build any kind of applications. Unfortunately, in some scenarios, the functionality that programming languages by themselves provide is not enough.</p>



<p>Let’s imagine that you want to build a house and have every kind of tool in your possession. Hammers of every imaginable size and shape, shovels, chainsaws, electric drills, concrete mixers, and so on. The problem is, to build a door, you’ll have to go to the forest, find a suitable tree, cut it into parts, match them together, paint, attach handles and hinges. Crafting a window will take much more time and effort. Plus, no one knows what glass is made of.</p>



<p>The more optimal approach implies the use of pre-build components you can combine following specific rules and using the tools you have. You can use bricks to build the walls and shingles to cover the roof. Doors, windows, and pipes can be combined to ensure that the house of your dreams looks and functions the way you want. However, one must not forget to test everything to make sure that the chimney does not fall off every time you try to open a window.</p>



<p>As you may have guessed, in this analogy, ready-to-use blocks represent frameworks. Developers use programming languages (hammers, shovels, etc.) to build frameworks (doors and windows) to be used by other developers in their applications.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>CSS framework&#8217;s</strong> </p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Bootstrap</strong></li>
</ul>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/2918581.png" alt="" class="wp-image-859" width="199" height="199"/></figure>



<p>Bootstrap is a free and open-source tool collection for creating responsive websites and web applications. It is the most popular HTML, CSS, and JavaScript framework for developing responsive, mobile-first websites. Nowadays, the websites are perfect for all the browsers (IE, Firefox, and Chrome) and for all sizes of screens (Desktop, Tablets, Phablets, and Phones).All thanks to Bootstrap developers – Mark Otto and Jacob Thornton of Twitter, though it was later declared to be an open-source project.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Tailwind</strong></li>
</ul>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/download.png" alt="" class="wp-image-860" width="203" height="124"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Tailwind CSS is basically a Utility first CSS framework for building rapid custom UI. It is a highly customizable, low-level CSS framework that gives you all of the building blocks that you need. Also, it is a cool way to write inline styling and achieve an awesome interface without writing a single line of your own CSS. <br>There are many CSS frameworks but people always choose the fast and easy framework to learn and use in the project. Tailwind has come with inbuilt a lot of features and styles for users to choose from and is also used to reduce the tendency of writing CSS code and create a beautiful custom UI. It will help you to overcome complicated task.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure>



<ul>
<li><strong>Foundation</strong></li>
</ul>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/foundation-logo-AA9B725281-seeklogo.com_.png" alt="" class="wp-image-861" width="154" height="229"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">A Foundation is an open-source and responsive front-end framework created by ZURB in September 2011 that makes it simple to create stunning responsive websites, apps, and emails that operate on any device. Many companies, like Facebook, eBay, Mozilla, Adobe, and even Disney, use it. The framework is based on bootstrap, which is similar to SaaS. It’s more complex, versatile, and configurable.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Similarly, there are many more frameworks of CSS like skeleton, animate, semantic, tacit, bulma, etc&#8230;</p>



<p><strong>JAVASCRIPT Framework&#8217;s</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><strong>React.Js</strong></li>
</ul>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/1460px-React_logo.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-864" width="177" height="162"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It’s ‘V’ in MVC. ReactJS is an open-source, component-based front-end library responsible only for the view layer of the application. It is maintained by Facebook.React uses a declarative paradigm that makes it easier to reason about your application and aims to be both efficient and flexible. It designs simple views for each state in your application, and React will efficiently update and render just the right component when your data changes. The declarative view makes your code more predictable and easier to debug.</figcaption></figure>



<ul>
<li><strong>Angular Js</strong></li>
</ul>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/AngularJS-Shield.svg" alt="" class="wp-image-865" width="219" height="232"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">AngularJS is&nbsp;<strong>a Javascript open-source front-end framework that is mainly used to develop single-page web applications(SPAs)</strong>. It is a continuously growing and expanding framework which provides better ways for developing web applications. It changes the static HTML to dynamic HTML.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Why we use Angular?</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Easy to work with:</strong>&nbsp;All you need to know to work with AngularJs is basics of HTML,CSS and Javascript,not necessary to be an expert in these technologies.</li>



<li><strong>Time-saving:</strong>&nbsp;AngularJs allows us to work with components and hence we can use them again which saves time and unnecessary code.</li>



<li><strong>Ready to use template:</strong>&nbsp;AngularJs is mainly plain HTML, and it mainly makes use of the plain HTML template and passes it to the DOM and then the AngularJS compiler. It traverses the templates and then they are ready to use.</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li><strong>Next.Js</strong></li>
</ul>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/download-1.png" alt="" class="wp-image-866" width="296" height="59"/></figure>



<p><strong>Next.js</strong>&nbsp;is a react based framework. It has powers to Develop beautiful Web application for different platform like Windows, Linux and mac. If you have little experience in react and looking forward to know more about react ecosystem then you should have knowledge about Next.js framework. Let’s have a brief introduction about Next.js.</p>



<p>Next.js is based on react, webpack and babel. It is an awesome tool for creating web application and famous for server-side rendering. Next.js is build by&nbsp;Zeit. Developers with knowledge of HTML, CSS, Java Script and React can easily learn and switch to next.js.</p>



<p><strong>Main Features:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Hot Code Reloading:</strong>&nbsp;It automatically reloads the application when changes in the code get saved.</li>



<li><strong>Automatic Code Splitting:</strong>&nbsp;By this feature, every import in the code get bundled and served with each page. It means that unnecessary code never get loaded on the page.</li>



<li><strong>Ecosystem Compatibility:</strong>&nbsp;Compatible with JavaScript, Node and react.</li>



<li><strong>Server Rendering:</strong>&nbsp;Easily render react component on server before sending HTML to client.</li>



<li><strong>Styled-JSX:</strong> Styled-JSX allows you to write CSS directly inside JavaScript code.</li>
</ul>
